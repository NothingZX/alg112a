Hilbert Question 2: Question Background: Hilbert's second question is one of the twenty-three questions posed by Hilbert, which explores the completeness and consistency of axiomatic systems in mathematics. Essence of the problem: The question asks whether there is a deductive system that can be both complete (all true statements are provable) and consistent (without causing contradictions).
Gödel's Theorem of Completeness and Incompleteness: Gödel's work: Kurt Gödel proposed Gödel's theorem of completeness and incompleteness in 1931. Completeness: Gödel's completeness theorem states that any axiom system of sufficient strength will contain an unprovable true statement. Incomplete: Gödel's incompleteness theorem states that for any axiom system that contains elementary arithmetic, there is always a statement that can neither be proven true nor false.
Church vs Lambda Calculus: Lambda Calculus: Lambda Calculus is a formal computational model proposed by Alonzo Church in the 1930s, which is a simple, general-purpose computational model for describing function applications and recursion. Church-Turing Hypothesis: Lambda Calculus and Turing machine equivalent, which supports the Church-Turing hypothesis, which suggests that any valid computation can be simulated by a general-purpose computer
Turing, Turing Machine, and Stop Problems: Turing Machine: Turing proposed the Turing machine in 1936, which is an abstract computer model capable of simulating all possible calculations. Stop Problem: Turing posed the stop problem, asking if there was an algorithm that could determine whether any given algorithm and input would stop in a finite step. He proved that the problem is unsolvable.
The relationship between the Chomsky class and the machine: Chomsky Class: Chomsky class is a linguistic hierarchy that divides computer language into four levels, from finite automata to Turing machines. Computing power: The Chomsky class articulates these different levels of language and the computing power of machines, with higher-level machines capable of simulating lower-level machines.
Steven Cook, SAT & NP-Complete: Steven Cook: In 1971, Steven Cook proposed the study of computational complexity and the famous concept of "polynomial time reduction". SAT Questions: SAT (Boolean Satisfiability Questions) is an NP-Complete question that asks if a Boolean expression has an assignment of a variable that makes the expression true. NP-Complete: Cook's work introduced the concept of NP-Complete, a class of intractable problems that can be solved if any of them can be solved in polynomial time. Together, this set of concepts and results depicts a fundamental understanding of computing power, problem solvability, and complexity in the field of computer science. These ideas and theorems have influenced the development of modern computer science and algorithm design.
